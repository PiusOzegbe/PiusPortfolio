    <p>
      During my free time and outside my day job, I work on a ton of side projects (and unsuccessfully so far; proper products). I am very interested in making developer tools and trying out new (to me) technologies to see things from a different perspective and fill in the blanks for things I may not know from working with my usual stack. Here are some of the things I have handpicked but you can find a lot more of them on my <a href="https://github.com/aosasona" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.
    </p>

    <div class="mt-4 space-y-6">
      {projects.map((project) => <ProjectPreviewListItem project={project} />)}
    </div>
  </main>
</Layout>
