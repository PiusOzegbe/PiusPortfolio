      <p>
        Hiya! I am Ayodeji, a software developer, your friendly Neovim enjoyer and a software engineering student somewhere in England. I am constantly learning and very keen on
        crafting the type of software experience I'd like to use and you can fall in love with - performant, intuitive, real-time, local-first and out of your way. I am a big fan
        of statically-typed compiled languages but I frequently (have to) dabble in <a href="/tools">other things</a> too. I write here from time to time (although mostly about software
        and not as often as I'd like to) and I also stream some Fridays on <a href="https://twitch.tv/iamtrulyao">Twitch</a>.
