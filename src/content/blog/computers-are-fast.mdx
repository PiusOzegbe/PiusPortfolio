I logged on to ~~Twitter~~ X today and I saw a thread with a discussion that reminded me of something I have been thinking about a lot lately, it was [this tweet](https://x.com/mattpocockuk/status/1814247057286189102?s=46&t=oZkX14dN7BKTYc0mRw0ryg). Hang on, hang on, let me explain before you burn me at the stake for disagreeing that it is neglible. Actually, I do agree that it is neglible in the CI case (which is what they are referring to here), I am not here to argue against that. The amount of time it would take Github Actions to start and get to your actual job would eat up any gains anyway; 200ms is indeed neglible here for **most** people.
