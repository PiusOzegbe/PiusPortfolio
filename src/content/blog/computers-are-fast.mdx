I logged on to ~~Twitter~~ X today and I saw a thread with a discussion that reminded me of something I have been thinking about a lot lately, it was [this tweet](https://x.com/mattpocockuk/status/1814247057286189102?s=46&t=oZkX14dN7BKTYc0mRw0ryg). Hang on, hang on, let me explain before you burn me at the stake for disagreeing that it is neglible. Actually, I do agree that it is neglible in the CI case (which is what they are referring to here), I am not here to argue against that. The amount of time it would take Github Actions to start and get to your actual job would eat up any gains anyway; 200ms is indeed neglible here for **most** people.

I did not grow up with *fast* software or in "the early days" of computers by any means, I grew up in the iPhone 3G and Windows XP era which wasn't so long ago, but the more I interact with the tech community and use newer software (even the ones I had written myself and perhaps even will still write in the next couple of months), the more I feel like we have forgotten how powerful computers are and how fast they really can be!
